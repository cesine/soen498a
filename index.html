<h3>1.4.2 Practice </h3>

<p>Try Exercise 1 on page 75. <br />

"On the website, under Ex 1 chapter 2, you will find a picture of a personal resume template. Constuct a personal resume using the general idea of that template. You may embellish the resume, but use the same general structure in terms of the lists and borderless tables used to create columns. Use CSS (not the depreciated font element) to format the text (face, size, color), applying at least three different style classes. "<br />

<h1>Lab 2 - January 19</h1>

<h2>2.1 Questions from lecture?</h2>


<h2>2.2 JavaScript Concepts</h2>

Go through the <a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap03/chap3.html">Chapter 3 slides</a>.


<h2>2.3 JavaScript Tutorial</h2>

Here are three learning options:
<blockquote>


<h3>2.3.1 Learn by reverse-engineering</h3>

After going through the slides look through the JavaScript Examples in the Figur
es (executable) section of the <a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap03/chap3.html">Chapter 3 webpage</a>. Compare the source code with the output.

<h3>2.3.2 Learn selectively by reference</h3>
<p>
If you are already comfortable programming here is a <a href="http://www.wdvl.com/Authoring/JavaScript/Tutorial/">JavaScript Tutorial for Programmers</a> </p>

<h3>2.3.3 Learn by Video</h3>

If you are new to both programming and JavaScript here are some tutorials on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorials&search_type=">YouTube</a>

<ul>
	<li class="c1"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT_8Dvk5GIQ">Overview of JavaScript Functions</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>2.3.4 JavaScript Debugging</h3>
<p>Everyone will probably want to read: <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/JavaScript_Debugging_for_Beginners">JavaScript Debugging for Beginners</a>
</p>
<p>More information about Debugging can be found on the <a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap03/chap3.html">Chapter 3 website</a></p>

</blockquote>

<h2>2.4 Practice</h2>

<p> Try Exercise 4 on page 136.<br />


</p>


<h2>2.5 Practice JavaScript Control Statements (If &amp; While)</h2>

<p>
Download the <a href="090119lab2/calculator.html">JavaScript Calculator</a> example which was talked about in Chapter 3. Create an exponential operator, "^" which raises num1 to the power of num2. In other words, if num1=2 and num2=3, then
num1 ^ num2 should be 8. The program should work even if num1 is not an integer.

</p>
<p>
<b>Advanced</b>
As a further modification, restrict num2 to be an integer, and send an alert if num2 is not an integer.<br />
(Hint: Use google to find how other code implements this feature)
</p>

<h2>2.6 Practice</h2>

<p>Try Exercise 17 on page 139.<br />


</p>

<h2>2.7 Work on Assignment 1 (HTML)</h2>

Assignment 1 is due next week, before you leave today you should show me your working code.

<h2>2.8 Work on Assignment 2 (JavaScript)</h2>

Assignment 2 is due Feb 2 It uses java script, before you leave today you should at least start it and identify what additional knowledge you might need to implement it.
<hr />
<h1>Lab 3 - January 26</h1>
<h2>3.1 Read email on how to run Perl cgi on clipper</h2>
Everyone should have recieved an email which gives them access to a group account which they will use to make their Web Application. Since there are few students we will have group size of 1 (which is why each of you have a group account). The email also explains how to run perl cgi scripts at Concordia. Scripts can only be run on clipper.encs.concordia.ca.

<h2>3.2 Set up the preferences for .cshrc</h2>

As specified in the email, Edit/create the file ~/.cshrc to have a line which says umask 700.

<h2>3.3 Create and run a php script</h2>
<p> In the directory discussed in the email (which should be roughly /www/groups/a/a?_soen498a_4 ) you should create a php script called date.php following the code in the bottom of the email. </p>


<h2>3.4 Create and run a perl cgi script</h2>

In the same directory copy and past the perl script into a file called date.cgi.

<h3> Possible bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to have #!/usr/bin/perl (or #!/encs/bin/perl) at the top of your file</li>
<li>Be sure to have the line print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; at the top of the cgi script, other wise the script will display rather than run</li>
<li>Be sure to use / in your html close tags, rather than \ (\ is for an excape character in perl and many other languages)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.5 Practice</h2>
<p>Put the <a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/downloads/source/chap04/randomimage/randomimage.cgi">randomimage.cgi</a> script in your folder on clipper and try to make it work.
</p>

<h1>Lab 4 - February 4</h1>

<h2>4.1 More perl scripting</h2>


<p>Create a short perl script that counts words in a string.</p>
<p>
Click here for a <a href="http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=CPTPAnK3Lec">video tutorial</a>
</p>
<p>
The script illustrates the use of subroutines, hashes, foreach loops on arrays and the split command.</p>

Or you can open it locally by typing:<br />

 totem /www/home/v/v_cook/teaching/perl-wordcount.ogg & </p>



<h2>4.2 Practice</h2>

<a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap03/chap3.html">Chapter 3 examples</a> of Webforms and Javascript
</p>

<p>
Exercise 9 p. 222. Create an HTML page that contains a form with two text fields: one for a user name and one for a password. The form shoudl be submitted to a CGI program that you create. Store five user names and passwords in a text file. If the submitted user name and password match (test using case-insensitive string equality) a pair found in your file, return a page to the browser that states "login successful," Otherwise, return a page to the browser that contains one of the two messages: "User not found" or "User valid, but password does not match." If you use the GET method of form submission, the following lines of code will recover the user name and password submitted to the program from the form.
<pre>
($user, $pass) = split (/&/, $ENV{"QUERY_STRING"} , 2);
($junk, $user) = split(/=/, $user, 2);
($junk, $pass) = split(/=/, $pass , 2);
</pre>

The $user and $pass variables will contain the entered data. The $junk variable will contain the name you give to the password element, which is not needed in the program.

<h2>5.2 Practice string matching in Perl</h2>

Do Exercise 4.a p 276 of the textbook. <br />

<p>Redo the exercise from last week, now however, you should use the <a href="http://www.cknuckles.com/webapps/chap06/chap6.html" target="top">full decoding routine</a>. In particular, weird characters may now be used in the user names and passwords.

<h2>Design your Blackjack Game (see features in Assignment 6)</h2>

Start looking at the features that are requested in Assignment 6 where the game will be nearly finished, (including multiplayer, adjustable bets and statistics database). Consider an over all design that will allow you to build towards those features without having to rewrite your code between Assignment 4 and Assignment 6.

<h2>Pass by ref in perl</h2>

<h2>How to require variables to be declared (easier debuging): use strict</h2>

<p>
Look at the <a href="090316lab9/" target="top">useStrictExample.pl</a> script. Many bugs in Perl come from the fact that you don't have to declare variables before using them. This means that you can have a typo where you meant to have a variable that you used before but Perl won't complain (no compile error). The "use strict;" will make Perl act like other languages; you will have to declare your variables with a "my" in front of them.<br/>

<h3>Debugging - ^M</h3>

Beware of ^M if you edit your files on windows you might have line feed characters which the perl on the Clipper server will not be able to interpret. </p>

To remove the dos line feed type at the command line <tt> dos2unix filename.txt </tt>
